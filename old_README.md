 * ESP-Now-Serial-Bridge
 *
 * ESP32 based serial bridge for transmitting serial data between two boards
 *
 * The primary purpose of this sketch was to enable a MAVLink serial connection,
 *   which I successfully tested at 57600 bps.  In theory, much faster buad rates
 *   should work fine, but I have not tested faster than 115200.
 *
 * Range is easily better than regular WiFi, however an external antenna may be
 *   required for truly long range messaging, to combat obstacles/walls, and/or
 *   to achieve success in an area saturated with 2.4GHz traffic.
 * 
 * I made heavy use of compiler macros to keep the sketch compact/efficient.
 *
 * To find the MAC address of each board, uncomment the #define DEBUG line, 
 *   and monitor serial output on boot.  Set the OPPOSITE board's IP address
 *   as the value for RECVR_MAC in the macros at the top of the sketch.
 *   
 * The BLINK_ON_* macros should be somewhat self-explanatory.  If your board has a built-in
 *   LED (or you choose to wire an external one), it can indicate ESP-Now activity as
 *   defined by the macros you choose to enable.
 *
 * When uploading the sketch, be sure to define BOARD1 or BOARD2 as appropriate
 *   before compiling.
